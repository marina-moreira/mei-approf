    "1. Performance Metrics\n",
    "+ Evaluate the models on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "+ Specifically, check if the accuracy for each selected class exceeds 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Comparative Analysis\n",
    "+ Compare the performance of models with different RNN layers (e.g., traditional RNN vs. LSTM).\n",
    "+ Assess the impact of varying time windows on classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Robustness Analysis\n",
    "+ Analyze how different combinations of RNN layers and time windows affect the overall accuracy and robustness of the models.\n",
    "+ Discuss any trade-offs observed between model complexity, training time, and performance"
