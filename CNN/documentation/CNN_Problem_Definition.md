"><strong>Bird Species Classification Project 
</strong></h1>


## Problem Definition

Bird species recognition is a complex task that challenges the visual capabilities of both human experts and computer algorithms. Accurate classification of birds by species using imagery data collected from aerial surveys is critical for ecological monitoring and conservation efforts. This task is also significant for companies developing wind farms, as accurate species recognition is essential for assessing and mitigating the risk of bird collisions.

## Objectives

1. **Achieve high model performance:** The primary objective is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that achieves high accuracy in classifying bird species.
2. **Analyze the impact of CNN parameters:** Investigate the effects of different filters, strides, padding, and pooling methods on model performance.
3. **Apply and evaluate data augmentation techniques:** Understand how data augmentation improves model performance and generalization.
4. **Compare custom models with pre-trained models:** Evaluate the performance of custom CNN models against pre-trained networks like ResNet50.
5. **Address overfitting:** Detect and mitigate overfitting to improve model robustness and accuracy.

## Questions and Tips

1. What is the impact of different filters, strides, padding, and pooling methods on the model's performance?
2. Illustrate the convolution result of a specific layer using example input images. What insights can be derived from it?
3. Apply data augmentation and make conclusions regarding the model performance with and without those techniques
4. Analyze overfitting. If detected, specify, and apply a solution.
5. Train with a pre-trained network (e.g. Resnet50) and compare the results with your model.


**1**. **Impact of Different Filters, Strides, Padding, and Pooling Methods**
   - **Tip:** Experiment with various configurations and document their impact on model performance. Use visualization tools to show the effects of these parameters on feature maps.
   - **Example:** "Changing the filter size from 3x3 to 5x5 increased the model's ability to capture larger features but also increased computation time."


**2.** **Illustrate Convolution Results of a Specific Layer**
   - **Tip:** Use a few sample images to visualize the output of a particular convolutional layer. Discuss any patterns or features observed.
   - **Example:** "The first convolutional layer highlighted edges and textures, which are crucial for distinguishing between similar bird species."


**3.** **Impact of Data Augmentation**
   - **Tip:** Apply various data augmentation techniques and compare model performance with and without augmentation.
   - **Example:** "Data augmentation improved the model's generalization ability, reducing overfitting and increasing validation accuracy by 5%."


**4.** **Overfitting Detection and Solutions**
   - **Tip:** Identify signs of overfitting by comparing training and validation metrics. Implement regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay.
   - **Example:** "Adding a dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 helped mitigate overfitting, as evidenced by the reduced gap between training and validation accuracy."


**5.** **Training with Pre-trained Network**
   - **Tip:** Fine-tune a pre-trained network and compare its performance with your custom model. Discuss the benefits and limitations of using pre-trained models.
   - **Example:** "Fine-tuning ResNet50 resulted in faster convergence and higher accuracy compared to the custom CNN model, highlighting the effectiveness of transfer learning."
