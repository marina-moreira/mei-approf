"><strong>Motion Activity Classification Project Using RNNs 
</strong></h1>

## Problem Definition

For this problem set, students are tasked with developing a deep learning model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify various motion activities based on sensory data from motion sensors. The dataset includes data on activities such as sitting, jogging, walking, and standing, captured as time series.

**Dataset Link:** [MotionSense Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset?select=A_DeviceMotion_data)

### Objectives

1. **Explore the impact of different RNN layers** (e.g., LSTM and traditional RNNs) on classification performance.
2. **Investigate the effect of varying time windows** on the model's ability to classify different motion activities.
3. **Analyze the influence of different combinations of RNN layers and time windows** on overall model accuracy and robustness.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Loading and Exploring the Data**
  - Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure and content.
  - Visualize the distribution of activities and check for any missing values or anomalies.

- **Normalization**
  - Normalize sensor data to ensure consistent input ranges for the RNN model.

- **Creating Time Windows**
  - Segment the continuous sensor data into fixed-size time windows suitable for RNN processing.

### Model Development

- **Designing RNN Architectures**
  - Experiment with different RNN architectures, including traditional RNNs and LSTM layers.
  - Evaluate how the depth and complexity of the network affect classification performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and the number of units in RNN layers.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Training the Model**
  - Train the RNN models on the preprocessed data.
  - Use validation data to tune the model and prevent overfitting.

- **Evaluating Performance**
  - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualize training and validation loss and accuracy curves to monitor training progress.

## Questions and Tips

1. **How does the choice of RNN layers, such as LSTM and traditional RNNs, affect the classification performance?**
   - **Tip:** Compare the performance of models using traditional RNN layers with those using LSTM layers. Highlight the differences in accuracy, training time, and stability.
   - **Example:** "The LSTM model outperformed the traditional RNN model, achieving higher accuracy and demonstrating better handling of long-term dependencies in the time series data."

2. **What is the impact of varying time windows on the model's ability to classify different motion activities?**
   - **Tip:** Experiment with different time window sizes and analyze how they affect the model's performance. Larger windows may capture more context but could introduce noise, while smaller windows may miss important information.
   - **Example:** "Using a time window of 50 timesteps resulted in the highest classification accuracy, suggesting a balance between capturing sufficient context and avoiding noise."

3. **How do different combinations of RNN layers and time windows influence the model's overall accuracy and robustness?**
   - **Tip:** Test various combinations of RNN layers (e.g., single-layer vs. multi-layer) and time windows. Document the results and discuss the trade-offs between complexity and performance.
   - **Example:** "A model with two LSTM layers and a time window of 100 timesteps achieved the best robustness, maintaining high accuracy across different activities and minimizing overfitting."
